<h1>First steps with AngularJS</h1>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Develop a simple web page using AngularJS. The idea is to create a fake email website which 
shows a list of emails received by a user, show the details of each email in a different area and
have a form to add new emails to the list.<p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Email should contain 'from', 'subject' and 'body'</li>
  <li>For each email in the list, 'from' and 'subject' should be shown</li>
  <li>For each element in the list, two buttons: 'view' and 'delete' should appear</li>
  <li>When a user clicks on 'view', details of the email should be displayed</li>
  <li>When a user clicks on 'delete', the email should be removed</li>
  <li>A form to create new emails must be included:
      <ul>
        <li>'Add email' button</li>
        <li>'From', 'Subject' and 'Body' inputs</li>
        <li>To submit, all fields are mandatory</li>
        <li>When a field is not valid, an error message should appear</li>
        <li>'Add email' button must be disabled until all fields are valid</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using an input field, emails should be filtered</li>
  <li>Using a combo field, emails should be ordered by 'From' or 'Subject'</li>
</ul>
